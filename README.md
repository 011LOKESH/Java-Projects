# Aim:
â€¢ To design and develop a Java-based software system that enables efficient 
control and simulation of robotic systems, specifically the igus Rebel-4DOF 
robots, using XML data integration to communicate with the igus software.
# Objectives:
1. Understand and Analyze Robotic Control Systems:
2. Design Software Architecture:
3. XML Integration and Parsing:
4. Robot Simulation in Java:
5. Control Algorithms Implementation:

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
  This project focuses on the design and development of a Java-based control
software for igus Rebel-4DOF robots. It encompasses the creation of a
modular architecture that can communicate with igus software using XML
format. The project includes robot simulation, implementation of control
algorithms for 4 degrees of freedom, and real-time control capabilities.
Additionally, it involves testing the software's performance in simulated
environments and preparing comprehensive documentation for users. The
software aims to be flexible, scalable, and adaptable for future
enhancements or integrations with other robotic systems
